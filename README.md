# Clarity Path

This is a website for a fictional adult ADHD diagnostic and therapeutic service, called "Clarity Path", written using Next.js. The website contains a home page, an informational page on what ADHD is, a page about the provided services in more detail, and a contact page which contains a Google Maps Embed API call. There are also empty pages providing a space for an eventual blogs feature, an eventual search feature, and 404 and 500 pages for custom handling of those HTTP error codes. The website is optimised throughout for desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile users, and contains some nice CSS animations which occur on scroll, implemented using the React Intersection Observer NPM package.

## TODO

- Implement search feature

- Implement blogs feature

- Implement sign-up/log-in feature
